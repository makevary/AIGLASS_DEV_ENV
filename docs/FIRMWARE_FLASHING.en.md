# Firmware Flashing Guide

English | [中文](FIRMWARE_FLASHING.md)

This document describes how to flash compiled firmware to AI Smart Glasses devices.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

> **Device Pre-installed Firmware**: Your AI Smart Glasses device usually comes with pre-installed factory firmware and **can be used directly**.
>
> **Only need to re-flash firmware in the following situations**:
> - 🔧 You have modified firmware code and need to test new features
> - 🐛 Need to fix system issues or upgrade system version
> - 🔄 Device system damaged and needs recovery
> - 🆕 Need to install specific version of firmware
>
> **If this is your first time using the device, complete the basic workflow in the [Application Development Guide](APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT.en.md) first, then flash firmware only when needed.**

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- One AI Glasses developer sample (contact email to purchase)
- USB data cable (for connecting device and host)
- Development host (Windows/Linux)

### Software Requirements
- Compiled firmware file (update.img)
- SocToolKit flashing tool
- ADB tool (Android Debug Bridge)

## 🔧 Preparation

### 1. Get Firmware File

After firmware compilation completes, use the local output image directly:

#### Build in Host Environment

```bash
# Build in AIGLASS_DEV_ENV workspace root
./setup_build_env.sh

# Choose one
# Device with display capability (default)
./build.sh

# Device without display capability
./build.sh --without-display

# Firmware output path
ls -lh output/image/update.img
```

### 2. Prepare Flashing Tool

SocToolKit flashing tool is located in the project's `tools` directory, select the version for your operating system:

```
tools/
├── Windows/
│   └── SocToolKit/
│       └── SocToolKit.exe
└── Linux/
    └── SocToolKit/
        └── SocToolKit
```

## 📝 Flashing Steps

### Step 1: Start SocToolKit

Run the corresponding SocToolKit tool according to your operating system:

**Windows:**
```bash
tools/Windows/SocToolKit/SocToolKit.exe
```

**Linux:**
```bash
tools/Linux/SocToolKit/SocToolKit
```

### Step 2: Select Chip Model

In the SocToolKit interface:
1. Find the chip selection dropdown menu
2. Select **RV1106B** chip model

### Step 3: Connect Device

1. Use USB data cable to connect AI Smart Glasses to development host
2. Wait about **10 seconds** for system to recognize device

### Step 4: Enter Flashing Mode

You can use either of the following methods to enter flashing mode.

#### Method 1: Enter via Command

1. Open terminal/command prompt window

2. Enter the following command to enter device interactive command line:
   ```bash
   adb shell
   ```

3. After successful connection, you'll see the device command line prompt

4. Enter the following command in device command line to enter flashing mode:
   ```bash
   reboot loader
   ```

5. Wait a few seconds. The device should normally restart into loader mode. If it does not respond for a long time, follow the troubleshooting note below first.

> **Troubleshooting Note**: If `reboot loader` does not restart the device immediately, or the device never enters flashing mode, go back to the host and check the current process list with:
>
> ```bash
> adb shell top
> ```
>
> If you find an app or process name starting with `{`, note its PID and kill it with:
>
> ```bash
> adb shell kill -9 <PID>
> ```
>
> Then retry `reboot loader`. This usually means a boot script did not finish normally, leaving the system stuck and unable to switch into flashing mode.

#### Method 2: Enter via the Hardware Flash Button

Recommended when:
- The device cannot boot normally
- `adb` is unavailable
- `reboot loader` keeps failing

1. First make sure the device is fully powered off:
   - Set the power switch to off
   - Disconnect the USB cable between the device and the computer
2. Locate the flash button inside the small round hole on the temple:

   ![Flash button location](Images/刷机键.jpg)

3. Use a non-metal pointed tool such as a toothpick to press and hold the flash button
4. While still holding the button, connect the device to the computer with the USB cable
5. Wait until SocToolKit detects the device, then release the flash button
6. Once the device appears in the flashing tool, continue with the remaining flashing steps

### Step 5: Confirm Device Connection

In the SocToolKit interface:
- Check **USB Device** area
- Confirm device is recognized and displayed in list
![alt text](Images/SocToolKit-2.png)

### Step 6: Select Firmware File

1. Click **"Firmware..."** button in SocToolKit interface
2. In the file selection dialog that pops up, navigate to firmware directory
3. Select the **update.img** file you just compiled
4. Click **"Open"** to confirm selection

### Step 7: Start Flashing

1. Confirm firmware path is displayed correctly in interface
2. Click **"Upgrade"** button to start flashing
3. Wait for flashing progress bar to complete

During flashing:
- ⏳ Keep USB connection stable
- ⚠️ Do not disconnect device power
- ⚠️ Do not close SocToolKit tool
- 📊 Monitor progress bar and log information

### Step 8: Flashing Complete

1. When flashing progress reaches 100%, tool will prompt flashing success
2. Device will automatically restart
3. Wait for device to complete startup (about 10 seconds)

## ✅ Verify Flashing

### Method 1: Verify via ADB

```bash
# Connect device
adb shell

# Check device status
uname -a
```

### Method 2: Verify via Device Functions

1. Check if device display is normal
2. Check if camera function is normal
3. Check if audio function is normal
4. Complete connectivity validation by following "First-time Wi-Fi Provisioning Check" below

### First-time Wi-Fi Provisioning Check (Important)

1. Make sure your router has 2.4GHz Wi-Fi enabled, and your phone is connected to the target 2.4GHz network.
2. On an Android phone, open Wi-Fi settings and tap "Share" on the current network to generate a Wi-Fi QR code.
3. Put the glasses into provisioning mode (auto when booted without network, or manually by short-pressing the button 10 times).
4. Show the QR code on your phone to the glasses for scanning, then wait for a successful provisioning prompt.
5. If the QR code is from a 5GHz/5G network, the device cannot connect. Switch to 2.4GHz and share again.

> The mobile app is coming soon and will provide an easier provisioning entry.

## 🛠️ Common Issues

### 1. ADB Cannot Connect to Device

**Problem**: Prompt device not found when executing `adb shell`

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check device connection
adb devices

# If no devices, try restarting adb service
adb kill-server
adb start-server

# Check devices again
adb devices
```

### 2. Device Not Entering Loader Mode

**Problem**: After executing `reboot loader`, the device does not restart immediately or does not enter loader mode for a long time, and SocToolKit does not show the device

**Solutions**:
- First run the following command on the host to check whether there is an abnormal app or process name starting with `{`:
  ```bash
  adb shell top
  ```
- If such a process exists, note its PID and run:
  ```bash
  adb shell kill -9 <PID>
  ```
- After killing the abnormal process, retry `reboot loader`
- This usually means a boot script did not finish normally and the system is stuck
- If the device cannot boot, `adb` is unavailable, or the software method keeps failing, switch directly to "Method 2: Enter via the Hardware Flash Button" above
- Check if USB connection is stable
- Try changing USB port
- Try changing USB data cable
- Wait longer (sometimes takes 30 seconds)
- Manually restart device and try again

### 3. SocToolKit Cannot Recognize Device

**Problem**: Device connected but SocToolKit not showing

**Solutions**:
- Confirm correct chip model selected (RV1106B)
- Check if USB driver installed correctly (Windows system)
- Try running SocToolKit with administrator privileges (Windows system)
- On Linux system check USB device permissions:
  ```bash
  # View USB devices
  lsusb

  # Add udev rules (if needed)
  sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-rockchip.rules
  ```

### 4. Flashing Process Interrupted

**Problem**: Flashing progress bar stuck or error reported

**Solutions**:
- Check if USB connection is stable
- Check if firmware file is complete (compare file size and MD5)
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Recompile firmware and retry
- Try reducing USB transfer speed (in SocToolKit settings)

### 5. Device Cannot Boot After Flashing Complete

**Problem**: Flashing successful but device shows black screen or no response on boot

**Solutions**:
- Wait longer (first boot may take 2-3 minutes)
- Check if firmware matches hardware version
- Try re-flashing
- Check device hardware connections (battery, screen, etc.)
- View boot logs via serial port (if serial debug available)

### 6. Windows System Driver Issues

**Problem**: Windows system cannot recognize device

**Solutions**:
1. Download and install Rockchip USB driver
2. Check device status in Device Manager
3. Update or reinstall driver
4. Disable driver signature verification (for testing only)
